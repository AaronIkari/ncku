## Projects

### **Project 0A:** Basic Data Analysis
* Top-20 players with higest career efficiency scores

### **Project 0B:** Single Source Shortest Path
* Discover the shortest chain of friendships that connect a source actor and target actor

### **Project 1:** Community Detection
* Online competition of community detection.
* Develop an algorithm to determine the number of communities and nodes belongs to each community in given netowkrs

### **Project 2:** Network Generator
* Develop one or more algorithms that are able to generate synthetic but relistic networks.

### **Project 3:** Influence Maximization
* Develop an algorithm to approximate the influence spread of the greedy algorithm as close as possible.
